# EfficienGPT üöÄ

## Overview üåü

EfficienGPT is a **quick-learning engine** designed to optimize knowledge acquisition using the **Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**. By leveraging **GPT-4o**, **MongoDB Atlas**, and **Streamlit**, it provides **fast, insightful, and actionable learning experiences** tailored to individual needs.  

EfficienGPT allows users to:  
- Retrieve **focused insights** without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary details.  
- Store and access knowledge instantly with **MongoDB Atlas**.  
- Interact through a **clean, intuitive UI** powered by **Streamlit**.  

## Features ‚ö°

- **AI-powered Learning:** Uses GPT-4o to generate **precise and actionable insights**.  
- **Efficient Knowledge Storage:** Stores and retrieves insights securely via **MongoDB Atlas**.  
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides a **simple and distraction-free** interface for users.  
- **Pareto Principle Optimization:** Ensures that only the **most important 20% of knowledge** is delivered.  
- **Customizable Inputs:** Users define their **topic, available time, and use case** for tailored learning.

## API Key Configuration üîë  

EfficienGPT requires an **OpenAI API Key** to function properly.  

### 4. Generate an OpenAI API Key  

1. Go to the **[OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/signup/)**.  
2. Sign up or log in to your OpenAI account.  
3. Navigate to **API Keys** and create a new API key.  

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Using OpenAI‚Äôs API **requires payment** after free-tier usage is exhausted. Be mindful of costs.  

### 5. Store the API Key  

Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following line:  

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, you can set it as an environment variable:  

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # macOS/Linux
set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"    # Windows
```

## Running EfficienGPT  

### 6. Start the Streamlit App  

```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

This will launch the web interface where you can interact with EfficienGPT.

## Free Local Version (Using Ollama)  

If you want to run EfficienGPT **without incurring OpenAI API costs**, you can use **Ollama**, a local LLM runtime.  

### 1. Install Ollama  

Follow the installation guide here: **[Ollama Installation](https://ollama.ai/)**.  

### 2. Download a Local Model  

```bash
ollama pull mistral  # Or any other model you prefer
```

### 3. Run the Local Version  

Modify your `.env` file to use the local model:  

```plaintext
USE_LOCAL_MODEL=True
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral
```

Then, run the Streamlit app as usual:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will use **Ollama‚Äôs locally stored model** instead of the OpenAI API.
